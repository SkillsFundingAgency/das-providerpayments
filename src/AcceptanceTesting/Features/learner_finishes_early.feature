Feature: Provider earnings and payments where learner completes earlier than planned

    The earnings and payment rules for early completions are the same as for learners finishing on time, except that the completion payment is earned earlier.

    Background:
        Given the apprenticeship funding band maximum for each learner is 20000

    Scenario: A DAS learner, levy available, learner finishes one month early
        Given levy balance > agreed price for all months
		And the following commitments exist:
            | ULN       | priority | start date | end date   | agreed price |
            | learner a | 1        | 01/09/2017 | 08/09/2018 | 15000        |
        When an ILR file is submitted with the following data:
            | ULN       | learner type       | agreed price | start date | planned end date | actual end date | completion status |
            | learner a | programme only DAS | 15000        | 01/09/2017 | 08/09/2018       | 08/08/2018      | completed         |
